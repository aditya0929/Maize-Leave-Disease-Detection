Approach for this Project :

**Image segmentation**

is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and classifying different regions or objects within an image. In this project, I will explore three different approaches for image segmentation using deep learning models: **InceptionV3**, **MobileNet**, **VGG16**, and **VGG19**.
